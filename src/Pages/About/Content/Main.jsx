            Avant Garde Studio designs and produces luxury digital fashion NFTs
            and continuous profits to holders. Our unique technology, AG Portal
            allows AG NFTs to be converted into wearable assets that can be worn
            in AG compatible digital worlds including metaverses and games.
            Additionally, the holders will receive a continuous income stream
            from external sales of those fashion items in the physical and
            digital worlds.

            Unlike physical fashion items which you can only wear or carry to
            show your style, AG’s digital fashion items allow you to change your
            appearance, add digital effects, wear rare wearables, and more.

            Avant Garde Studio allows artists, fashion brands, and any designers
            to use the AG Portal technology for them to design their unique
            digital fashion NFTs and safely mint through our launchpad platform.
            Through limitless technical and operation support from Avant Garde,
            artists and designers will be able to show their creativity
            continuously in digital worlds.

            We believe one of the most fundamental values of NFT is its ability
            to generate a profit from outside of the project’s community. Avant
            Garde Studio will create an ecosystem in which the holders will
            indefinitely be provided with a profit share of fashion items that
            are sold individually in each digital world.
